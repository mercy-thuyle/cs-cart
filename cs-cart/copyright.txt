9. DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURE
The User acknowledges that the Company may suffer damage if the conditions of this Agreement are not respected, and therefore the User agrees that the Company has the right to use any form of protecting the violated rights and legitimate interests, including the direct appeal to the appropriate court without a necessity to comply with the claim settlement procedure.

You and Company agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the EULA, shall be determined by binding arbitration in San Diego County, California, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. You agree that, by agreeing to these EULA, the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that you and Company are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim.

10. FINAL PROVISIONS
These EULA shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, USA without regard to conflict of laws provisions. If any provision or provisions of these terms shall be held to be invalid, illegal, unenforceable or in conflict with the law of any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and shall remain in full force and effect.

If any condition of this Agreement for any reason becomes unenforceable, or is voided or declared invalid by the competent court, then it is regarded as an omission from the text of this Agreement, which, however, shall by no means affect the legitimacy and validity of the other conditions.

The section headings in the text of the Agreement are for convenience only and have no independent legal force, and shall not be interpreted in relation to the conditions of the Agreement.

The User acknowledges that he has read this Agreement carefully and understood it completely, and agrees to accept its terms and conditions.

The Parties acknowledge the legal validity of the documents sent by email. The documents sent by the Company are considered created in the proper written form if they are sent from sales@cs-cart.com. Documents emanating from the User will be deemed completed in proper writing if they are sent from the email address provided by the Company User in accordance with Section 1 of this Agreement. Correspondence will be considered sent to the proper address if it is sent to the above email addresses.
