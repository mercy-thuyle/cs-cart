msgid "<p>Development isn\\'t only about adding new features. A lot of effort goes into maintaining existing ones. By discontinuing the features that aren\\'t widely used, we can focus on what\\'s really important and deliver updates faster. The \"Suppliers\" add-on is one such feature we have doubts about. But we wouldn\\'t want that to interfere with your business or prevent you from getting the latest improvements.<br/><p> That\\'s why we have marked the \"Suppliers\" add-on as [Deprecated]. Your store will keep it when you move to newer versions. But we intend to remove it from new installations and stop updating it. If you feel that we\\'re wrong, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/index.php?dispatch=communication.tickets&submit_ticket=Y\">please let us know how you use \"Suppliers\"</a>. Depending on the feedback we get, we may reconsider. <p> <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"btn btn-large btn-primary\" href=\"https://helpdesk.cs-cart.com/index.php?dispatch=communication.tickets&submit_ticket=Y\">Tell us what you think<\\/a>"
